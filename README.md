# Grandeurkoe Portfolio

My portfolio website, your gateway to my digital world where you can discover my work, skills, and passion for technology.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<b>For Windows:</b>
<br/> 

Download and Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).<br/>

## Deployment

Deploying a simple portfolio website on GitHub Pages involves several straightforward steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - Log in to your GitHub account.
   - Click on the "+" sign in the upper right corner and select "New repository."
   - Name your repository with the following format: `[username].github.io` (replace `[username]` with your GitHub username).

2. **Set Up Your Repository:**
   - You can either initialize the repository with a README or create a new one. It's best to include a README to describe your project.
   - Add your HTML, CSS, and other website files to your repository.

3. **Commit and Push:**
   - Use Git to commit and push your code to the repository. You can do this from your local development environment.

4. **Configure the Repository Settings:**
   - Go to the "Settings" tab in your repository.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Under the "Source" section, select the branch containing your website code (usually the `main` or `master` branch).
   - Save your changes.

5. **Wait for GitHub Pages to Build:**
   - It may take a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build your website. You can monitor the progress under the "GitHub Pages" section in the repository settings.

6. **Access Your Portfolio:**
   - Once the build is complete, you'll find the URL to your live website under the "GitHub Pages" section in the repository settings.

7. **Custom Domain (Optional):**
   - If you have a custom domain, you can configure it to point to your GitHub Pages website by updating your DNS settings. There are detailed instructions in the GitHub Pages settings for this.

That's it! Your portfolio website should now be live on GitHub Pages and accessible via the provided URL. You can continually update your website by pushing changes to your repository.
